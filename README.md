# TOPICS TO COVER

In this repository, I'll try to cover these topics:

- Angular, React, Vue
- Microservices & Microfrontends
- DDD, Contexts
- API: BFF, Management (quotas, throttling, security, testing,...)
- API First: synchronous & asynchronous
- Schema Registry
- Authorization & Authentication, OAuth, OpenID
- Quarkus, Spring, Python, Â¿Go?
- Working with legacy systems
- Databases:
  - Postgresql, MySQL
  - Redis
  - Mongo
  - ElasticSearch
  - DuckDB
- EDA: definition, design, infra

- Gen AI, RAG, LocalAI,...
- K8s & Istio
- Data & Analytics
  - Databricks
  - Snowflake
  - NiFi
  - Airflow
  - Iceberg
  - Apache Superset
- Testcontainers
- Automated testing

- Monitoring & Observability
- Serverless: lambdas & functions, containers (ECS Fargate)
- Platform Engineering, DevEx
- IaC (AWS, Azure, GCP):

The idea is to use a set of applications and systems working together in order to apply each topic to the use case where it is most relevant and explain the reason for using it. If there are several alternatives, I'll show the pros and cons of each one.

# Business domains

The first step we're going to do is to define business domains. I'm not a subject matter expert in retail or in ecommerce so I've tried to define my own retail. The following picture describes the domains defined:

So, we can see five domains (as I said, I'm not a retail expert). The details about them are:

- **Customers**: this domain is responsible of managing everything related to customer, that is, register process, customer application, notifications, etc...In this domain, I'm going to include a recommendation system in order to offer the best products for each client depending on navigation, needs, etc...
- **Products**: it's responsible of defining products (catalog)
- **Orders**: it manages the order workflow, that means, from an order is created to it is payed and closed. I'm going to include all capabilities relative to payments also in this domain (it could be an independent domain).
- **Sales**: it's responsible of managing prices, promotions and get insights from orders
- **Warehouse**: this domain is responsible of managing stock

Now, we are going to define some relationships between domains:
