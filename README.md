# TOPICS TO COVER

In this repository, I'll try to cover these topics:

- Angular, React, Vue
- Microservices & Microfrontends
- DDD, Contexts
- API: BFF, Management (quotas, throttling, security, testing,...)
- Authorization & Authentication, OAuth, OpenID
- Quarkus, Spring, Python, Â¿Go?
- Databases: Postgresql, MySQL, Mongo, ElasticSearch
- EDA: definition, design, infra
- Kafka, KStreams, KSQL, KConnect
- Working with legacy systems
- Spark, Flink
- CDC (Debezium,...)
- Gen AI, RAG, LocalAI,...
- Data & Analytics
  - Databricks?
  - Snowflake?
- Testcontainers
- Automated testing
- CI/CD
- Kubernetes (check if is possible RH)
- Monitoring & Observability
- Serverless: lambdas & functions, containers (ECS Fargate)
- IaC (AWS, Azure, GCP):
  - Terraform
  - CDK



The idea is to use a set of applications and systems working together in order to apply each topic to the use case where it is most relevant and explain the reason for using it. If there are several alternatives, I'll show the pros and cons of each one.
